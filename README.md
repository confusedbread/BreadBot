For obvious reasons the file .bot-key is not provided. Create your own and put in your bot key into the file.

### Prerequisites
* Python 3.5+ ; Lowest version tested: 3.6
* [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py)

Add new async event consumers: <br />
```python
@bot.event
async def on_some_event(payload):
    # send payload to data handler
    data_handler(payload)

These are defined by the Client API provided by `discord.py` (https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#client)
